Hi! i'm **Nonthawat Suwannachairop** (also known as NonthaNatsu)
I'm passionate about game design, art, and computer.

## My Current Project

- **Project Summer of me** (Main project)

    Play as Mapeed, a lively young girl setting out to explore tropical islands, assist her mother in field research, and capture the diverse stories and atmosphere across the archipelago.

- **Go Round and loud** (Development Paused)

    A game where you play as two siblings who leave behind the city life to start a mobile grocery business in the peaceful countryside â€” working hard to pay off their debts while finding warmth and meaning in a slower, simpler life.
